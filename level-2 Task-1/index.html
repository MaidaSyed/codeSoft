            <h1>The Father of Pakistan's Nuclear Program</h1>

            <h2>Early Life and Education:</h2>
            <p>Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan was born on April 1, 1936, in Bhopal, India. After completing his early education,
                he pursued a degree in Metallurgical Engineering from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.
                He later earned a Doctorate in Metallurgical Engineering from the Catholic University of Leuven in
                Belgium.</p>

            <h2>Contributions to Pakistan's Nuclear Program:</h2>
            <p>Dr. Khan's journey as a scientist took a significant turn when he joined Pakistan's nuclear program in
                the 1970s. His expertise and dedication played a pivotal role in transforming Pakistan into a
                nuclear-armed nation. He was instrumental in developing Pakistan's first successful uranium enrichment
